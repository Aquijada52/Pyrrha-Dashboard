This repository contains the [Prometeo](https://github.com/Code-and-Response/Prometeo) solution next generation in progress dashboard built on Carbon, React, and Flask. The dashboard shows the real-time and long-term averages of firefighter exposure to carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, temperature, and humidity. It also provides a way to create, read, update and delete devices and events.

## Setting up the solution

* The code is in a subdirectory as React does not support mixed case directories such as this top-level repo.
* See the basic React steps in the [dashboard app README](prometeo-dashboard/README.md).
* More detailed steps for the dependencies (MariaDB, Flask) are coming soon.
